# Change Log

## 1/5/2026
- `switch` statements now work fully.  
- All built-in operators are working, ex `++`, `--`, `!&`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=` etc.  
- All loops working, `do`, `do-while`, `while`, and `for`. Recursion as well naturally.  
- Added the ability to control memory better with `stack`, `heap`, `global`.
- A new `local` keyword is in the works, used to restrict scope.
