# Flux

**Note:** This language is still in development. A simplified version of Flux will be the first to release. It will not support templates, inheritance, `operator`, `contract`, `compt`, the *full* built-in operator set (all logical/bitwise operators), or macros. This is not a complete list of all that will not be supported. The reduced language specification can be found [here](https://github.com/kvthweatt/FluxLang/blob/main/language_specification_simplified.md).

Flux is a systems programming language, visually resembling C++ and Python.
