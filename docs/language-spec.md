# Flux Language Specification

## 1. Introduction

Flux is a modern systems programming language that combines the efficiency of low-level programming with high-level abstractions. It incorporates features from C++, Rust, and Python while introducing novel concepts for system-level programming.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Type System

Flux employs a static, strong type system with type inference capabilities. The basic types include:

- Primitive types: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, `void`
- Compound types: arrays, pointers
- User-defined types: objects, classes

### 2.2 Memory Management

The language uses a deterministic memory management system with:

- Stack-based allocation for primitive types
- Automatic cleanup through the `volatile` keyword
- Manual memory management capabilities when needed

### 2.3 Objects vs Classes

Flux distinguishes between two primary types of user-defined types:

#### Objects
- More flexible containers that can have both data and behavior
- Support runtime modification
- Can be marked as executable
- Suitable for dynamic programming patterns

#### Classes
- Strict containers for methods and members
- Compile-time checked
- Better suited for system-level programming
- Contained within namespaces

## 3. Unique Features

### 3.1 When Blocks

The `when` statement provides an interrupt-style programming model:

```cpp
when (condition) {
    // Triggered when condition is met
} volatile;  // Optional automatic cleanup
```

Key characteristics:
- Non-blocking execution
- Can be made volatile for automatic cleanup
- Suitable for event-driven programming

### 3.2 Custom Operators

Flux allows definition of custom operators with strict type checking:

```cpp
operator(Type1, Type2)[op] {
    // Implementation
};
```

Features:
- Type-safe operator overloading
- Support for custom operator symbols
- Precedence rules following the standard operator precedence

### 3.3 Assembly Blocks

Direct assembly integration through `asm` blocks:

```cpp
asm {
    // Assembly code
}
```

### 3.4 Namespace Organization

Namespaces serve as strict containers for classes:
- Enforce modularity
- Prevent naming conflicts
- Support hierarchical organization

## 4. Control Flow

### 4.1 Standard Control Structures

- `if`-`else` conditionals
- `for` and `while` loops
- `switch` statements
- `break` and `continue`

### 4.2 Error Handling

- Exception handling with `try`-`catch`
- Assert statements for debugging
- Error propagation mechanisms

## 5. Memory Safety

### 5.1 Safety Features

- Bounds checking for arrays
- Null pointer detection
- Memory leak prevention through volatile blocks
- Reference counting for shared resources

### 5.2 Performance Considerations

- Zero-cost abstractions where possible
- Compile-time checks for common errors
- Optional runtime checks

## 6. Concurrency

### 6.1 Async/Await

Support for asynchronous programming:
```cpp
async function() {
    await operation();
}
```

### 6.2 When-Based Concurrency

Using when blocks for concurrent operations:
```cpp
when (event_ready) volatile {
    // Concurrent operation
};
```

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Code Organization

- One class per file
- Namespaces for logical grouping
- Clear separation between interface and implementation

### 7.2 Naming Conventions
